<!-- OpenAI API Rate Limits -->
## 5. OpenAI API Rate Limits

A rate limit is a restriction that an API imposes on the number of times a user or client can access the server within a specified period of time. 
Rate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place to help protect against abuse or misuse, help  manage the aggregate load on infrastructure, and ensure that everyone has fair access.

To see the latest API rate limits per user tier please read the following: <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/overview">https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/overview</a>

Each cell in Excel where the CHATGPT.SENTIMENT formula is executed should be considered and counted as a single Request.
